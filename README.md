Highly customizable chat server/application that is easy to deploy, and can be integrated with any sort of website.
Host your own **chat server** on your own terms.

May be used by Twitch streamers who want to host their own chat server
away from Twitch infrastructure and moderation.

## Live demo

Playground for developers showing things you can do using HTTP/Websocket API.

## :warning: Work in progress...

This project is still in its beta stage. Nothing is guaranteed until v1.0.0.

## ðŸ”¥ Features

- First-class TypeScript support - IDE should be doing half the work for you
- Single repository (why monorepo? https://monorepo.tools/)
- :whale: Dockerized
- Not tied to any particular infrastructure or service - we are in a world where AWS, Firebase and Twitch do not exist
- Infinitely scalable with minimal changes
- Minimal dependencies

## Repository Structure

Entire application is **self-contained** within this single repository
which has many advantages during development.

- `/apps` folder contains "launchable" apps
- `/packages` folder contains "shared" code used by apps and by other packages too.

## :whale2: Local Development using Docker

Two things you need installed first:

- Node.js (>=16) - https://nodejs.org/
- Docker - https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

Now run these commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Athlon1600/chat
cd chat
npm run docker:dev
```

This will take a while, but once up and running
you will be able to access the following services
on your local computer:

- localhost:8080 = frontend
- localhost:3000 = server/backend
- localhost:9000 = adminer (for browsing/editing db contents)
- localhost:3309 = mySQL database
- localhost:6379 = Redis

## :rocket: One-click install

Rent a server from Linode or such (preferably of Ubuntu variety),
and paste the following command into your terminal:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Athlon1600/chat/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Everything will be installed all at once without needing any further input from you.

If install was a success, you can then access the application via the IP address that was assigned to your server. See
the demo links above of what that would look like.

### Caddy Server

One-click install:

```shell
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Athlon1600/chat/master/scripts/caddy.sh | sh
```

Once Caddy is installed, you need to modify these files:

- `.env.production` - rename to `.env` and change values inside
- `docker-compose-prod.yml` - adjust values there accordingly too
- `etc/Caddyfile`

```shell
caddy run --config ./etc/Caddyfile
```

## :construction: To-do list

- Build a proper `/admin` backend instead of doing management directly via database (adminer).
